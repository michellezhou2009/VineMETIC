This repository provides the R code for implementing the proposed method in the manuscript "Modeling times to multiple events under informative censoring with $C$-vine copula" by Xinyuan Chen, Yiwei Li, and Qian M. Zhou.

The file "example.R" provides the R code to analyze a simulated data set stored in "example.rds". The data was generated by the R file "example_gendata.R" following the simulation setting of Section 4.1 of the manuscript.

There are other R files in the folder.

- "helpers.R", "helpers_bvic.R", "helpers_trivic.R", and "cvine_trivic.R" for the proposed stagewise estimation and inference procedures;

- "fitSPT.R" for fitting a semi-parametric transformation model;

- "DataGenFuns.R" for generating simulated data of Simulation Study I.
